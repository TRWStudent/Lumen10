    remoBio1: 'Remo Mairhofer is an Attorney-at-Law and licensed trustee, serving as Founder and CEO of LUMEN ADVISORY Trust reg. and founder of Mairhofer Advokatur in Liechtenstein. His work focuses on the establishment, governance, and ongoing supervision of trust and foundation structures, advising intermediaries and private clients in cross-border structures.',
    remoBio2: 'He holds degrees in Law and Banking & Finance from the University of St. Gallen and an LL.M. from the University of Sydney. He is admitted to the Liechtenstein Bar, has completed the Liechtenstein trustee examinations, and serves as a Substitute Judge at the Constitutional Court of Liechtenstein.',
    tomaszName: 'Dr. Tomasz Klimek',
    tomaszTitle: 'Public Notary | Attorney-at-Law | Partner',
    tomaszBio1: 'Dr. Tomasz Klimek is a Public Notary and Attorney-at-Law in Liechtenstein and a partner at Mairhofer Advokatur. He advises on and oversees legally complex fiduciary and corporate structures, with a particular focus on cross-border foundations, holding entities, and asset-holding arrangements involving Liechtenstein, Austria, and Poland.',
    tomaszBio2: 'Dr. Klimek holds a Doctor of Laws from the University of Vienna and multiple LL.M. degrees in company, foundation, and trust law. He is admitted to the bar in Liechtenstein, Austria, and Poland and is the only Polish-speaking attorney in Liechtenstein, allowing him to bridge jurisdictions with precision and accountability.',
    servicesTitle: 'Our Services',
    familyOfficeTitle: 'Family Office',
    familyOfficePara1: 'We act as a central point of coordination where family structures become complex and scattered across borders. This often means aligning trusteeship, corporate holdings, asset managers, and advisors so that decisions remain clear, documented, and consistent over time.',
    familyOfficePara2: 'In practice, this can involve a family with operating companies in Austria, investment assets held through a Liechtenstein foundation, and family members living between Switzerland and Singapore—where governance rules, reporting lines, and trustee oversight need to work seamlessly despite very different legal environments.',
    successionPlanningTitle: 'Succession Planning',
    successionPlanningPara1: 'Succession planning is rarely about a single transfer; it is about control, protection, and continuity over many years. We structure succession solutions that respect family dynamics while remaining legally robust and enforceable across jurisdictions.',
    successionPlanningPara2: 'A typical mandate may involve a German entrepreneur transferring business interests and real estate into a Liechtenstein foundation, ensuring asset protection and clear succession rules while coordinating tax, inheritance, and trustee obligations in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.',
    relocationServicesTitle: 'Relocation Services',
    relocationServicesPara1: 'Relocation affects more than residency—it often changes how existing structures are viewed by authorities. We guide clients through relocations by adjusting legal and fiduciary frameworks early, so existing trusts, foundations, and holdings remain compliant and effective.',
    relocationServicesPara2: 'For example, when a family moves from Germany to Italy, existing Liechtenstein trust structures may need to be reviewed, reporting adjusted, and governance clarified to avoid unintended tax exposure or loss of substance after the relocation.',
    philanthropyTitle: 'Philanthropy',
    philanthropyPara1: 'Philanthropy works best when generosity is paired with structure. We help clients establish and manage philanthropic vehicles that allow long-term engagement while meeting regulatory and governance standards.',
    philanthropyPara2: 'This may include setting up a Liechtenstein charitable foundation that funds educational or social projects abroad, where board structures, approval processes, and cross-border funding flows are designed to remain transparent, compliant, and sustainable over time.',
    accountingTitle: 'Accounting',
    accountingPara1: 'Accounting within fiduciary structures is not just about numbers—it is about control and traceability. We provide accounting and reporting that supports trustee oversight and withstands regulatory and audit scrutiny.',
    accountingPara2: 'A common scenario involves a Liechtenstein foundation holding participations in operating companies in Austria and Poland, requiring consolidated reporting, asset tracking, and clear documentation aligned with trustee and board responsibilities.',
    legalAdviceTitle: 'Legal Advice & Notarial Services',
    legalAdvicePara1: 'Legal advice and notarial services are fully integrated into our fiduciary work, ensuring that structures are not only well designed but also properly executed and maintained.',
    legalAdvicePara2: 'This often includes the notarial establishment of foundations or companies, ongoing legal supervision, and cross-border coordination—such as when a Liechtenstein foundation holds international real estate and shareholdings and requires legally sound resolutions, transactions, and governance decisions across multiple jurisdictions.',
